<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As an ongoing independent project from late high school, I decided to program an artificially-evolving 
neural network simulator using basic creatures in a predefined environment. I took inspiration from 
several other community programmers who made similar programs. This was my first attempt at using a 
neural network to facilitate fitness-based evolution.

### Built With

* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
* [Processing 3](https://processing.org/)
* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

### The Environment

The environment of the simulation is a 100 by 100 grid of tiles, generated by a user-created .png image 
of the desired layout. The program reads the pixels' colors and decides if it is a water or land tile. 
The example shown here is a map that is mostly covered with land, with some minor water bodies providing 
boundaries and obstacles. Each tile contains a certain amount of food, a regeneration rate, and a cooldown 
timer for restarting the food regeneration process after it is completely depleted to discourage stagnant 
creatures.

[![Product Name Screen Shot][environment-image]]()

Each tile can either be land or water. Water tiles have no food and no regeneration, so it is extremely 
disadvantageous for a creature to remain in the water for a long period of time. The goal of this is to 
encourage the evolution of water-avoidant traits.

### Meet the Creatures

Shown here is an example of a creature in the simulator. Each creature has several sensors, which help 
it identify certain aspects of the environment, like the amount of food around it or if there is another 
creature nearby. These sensors are the source of input to the creature's neural network and help determine 
what actions the creature will take.

[![Product Name Screen Shot][creature-image]]()

Creatures that are successful at staying alive and feeding can produce offspring with slightly mutated 
genes, which imitates random genetic variation in humans.

### Neural Network Design

Each creature’s intelligence is determined by its internal neural network system. The values of the inputs 
and hidden layers represent the neurons, while the connections between them represent the axons of the network. 
A network of n countable neuron layers must have n - 1 axon layers. This closely resembles neural interaction 
in the human nervous system.

[![Product Name Screen Shot][neuron-image]]()

My simulation uses a feedforward neural nework design. In a feedforward design, input values are multiplied, 
summed, and run through a sigmoid function into hidden layers of values, which are then multiplied, summed, 
and run through sigmoid functions between each other as needed and finally into an output layer of values.
Here is a visualization of my network design.

[![Product Name Screen Shot][neuralnet-image]]()

The neuron values are shown as numbers, with axon lines ranging in shade from black (negative axon) to white 
(positive axon). Empty values are spaces left for future additions.

### Feedback System

In order for actual evolution in behavior to occur, some form of feedback from the environment is required. 
In this model, environmental fitness is the source of feedback. Creatures with a greater suitability to survive 
(fitness) are more likely to reproduce, passing on their network qualities. Over time, the networks of 
more-suitable creatures will dominate the landscape, and newly-developed traits among those suitable creatures 
will cause disruptions in any equilibrium that is established, leading to further refinement of the network 
pool as competition for resources drives evolution.

### Observed Traits

One of the most prevalent traits that can be seen in the simulator is the avoidance of disadvantageous tiles. 
Many creatures, in a map that includes bodies of water, will adapt to avoid water and tiles with little food. 
Being in these areas is disadvantageous because, while the creatures constantly decay, they will have no 
source of food.

[![Product Name Screen Shot][trait-image]]()

Here is an example of a creature with a neural network that learned to change direction or avoid water or 
foodless tiles completely when it encountered them. Some creatures tend to back away, some choose to speed 
up to get through, and some exhibit a combination of the two.

### Gene Evolution

As the simulation runs, it keeps track of how many creatures were alive and their genes through time. 
Creatures will similar neural networks will have similar colors for easy visual identification. Once certain 
suitable creatures grow in population to dominate the environment, resources become scarce and the population 
decreases, giving rise to new, more suitable populations.

[![Product Name Screen Shot][timeline-image]]()

In this example, dark green and dark pink/purple creatures dominated for a period of time. Once resources 
ran out, a period of turbulence followed as other more-suitable populations grew out of the scarcity, leading 
to descendants of the pink/purple populations to grow. Once those descendants grew to capacity and used up the 
newly available resources, more turbulence ensued which gave rise to yet another more-suitable descendant 
population of the purple neural network traits. This process repeats over and over again and is the driving 
force behind the neural network evolution. Watching the graphs reflecting this phenomenon in real time is truly 
fascinating, and I am very proud of these results!

### Limitations

Although this program has successfully achieved basic creature instincts, this network design has some important 
limitations. This is evolution with fixed topologies. In other words, since every creature has the same neural 
network structure, significant innovation is extremely difficult and time consuming. Stay tuned, as I am currently 
working on a project with neural networks that don't only evolve through numerical values, but in their very 
structure as well!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Try it Out

If you are interested, feel free to download and run [this][download-jar] file to view the simulation for yourself. 
You can also find it on this GitHub project repository. I'm sure you will enjoy watching and interacting with 
the creatures of the simulation!

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed on your system to run the .jar file.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once you run the file, the simulation will start immediately. Feel free to interact with the menu
to customize your simulation! Click on a creature or tile to see more information about it.
